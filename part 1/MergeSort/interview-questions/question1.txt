Lets call n to mid and 2 * n - 1 to 2 * mid - 1, and 2 * min = n. Copy the first subarray into aux array.
Given the both subarray with mid elements, the merge operation will do as following:
1- an index i for the whole array, starting at 0, and an index j to the second subarray, starting in mid, and another index k for aux array, starting at 0
3- while i < arr.lenght
4- if aux[k] < arr[j], arr[i] receives arr[k] and increment i and k by 1
5- if aux[k] > arr[j], arr[i] receives arr[j], and increment i and j
6- if k > mid, arr receives the rest of the arr between j and 2n - 1
7- if j > arr.lenght, arr receives the rest of the arr between k and mid

After these steps, arr will be sorted.

Hint: copy only the left half into the auxiliary array.
