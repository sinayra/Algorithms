Sort both arrays a and b and set the counter to 0. 
To sort a 2D points array, use Mergesort comparing y coordinate. If two points are collinear in y, check for it x coordinate.
Using merge sort requires ~N logN design approach.

Set indexes i, index for i, and j, index for b, to the array'start position and then while the indexes didn't reach the end of array a or end of array b:
1- if a[i] > b[j], increment j by 1
2- if a[i] < b[j], increment i by 1
3- if a[i] = a[j], increment the counter by 1 and increment both i and j by 1.
This approach is linear.
