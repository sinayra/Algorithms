# Algorithms
[Algorithms Coursera course](https://coursera.org/share/c54425f661da618dffedb7ba857a21c1), from Princeton University.

The Programming Assignments are in Java due the automatic report, but I'm also re-implementing most of the Java slides in C++. This way I'm reviewing and upgrading my C++ knowledge while studying algorithms.
